# Object-Tracking-using-Yolo-and-DEEPSORT
 Object tracking using yolov8 nano model and deepsort algorithm. Implementation done in the Final_detection.py 
Steps Invloved:
1. video upscaling and contrast improvement done in upscale_video.py
2. obtained output_upscaled.mp4
3. utilized it in final_detection.py for detecting number of objects in the video and timeframe of the objects in video
4. The obtained results metrics and output video implemented in html at the end of final_detection.py file.
